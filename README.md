Pamper Your Poultry site version 2

**Pampered Poultry Node.js e-commerce site**

This repository exists as a reference for my tech blog on implementing Node.js / HTML web sites. A live production implementation of this site can be seen at:

http://www.pamperyourpoultry.com

The site has an HTML5 browser state front end and is supported by a Node.js backend utilizing a MySQL database running on Ubuntu Linux.

In addition to the front-end customer e-commerce site, the application also hosts an administrative operations site to manage the back-end product catalog and order processing.


This new version of the site has been refactored to use Handlebars for templating, and payments are now processed using Paypal's Node SDK API.
